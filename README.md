# Docusaurus

This is a test site using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) static site generator.

The result is available here: https://leafy-taffy-3a7682.netlify.app/

Docusaurus uses JavaScript, React, and Markdown. It's customizable and extensible. 

Pages composed in Markdown can be automatically added to the sidebar navigation. React offers the potential for more complex pages and applications, such as an equipment inventory.

You can see some of the potential here: https://docusaurus.io/showcase
