# Opening Title

Here's the opening of this blog post. I have added tags to this post, and I have added a slug. The slug is the name of the file, but without the date and the .md extension. The slug is used to create the URL for the blog post. The URL for this blog post is https://nbarbarick.github.io/blog/blank-blog-post.

I am also adding text using GitHub Copilot. Most of the text in this post is generated by Copilot. I am adding a few words here and there to make it more readable. 

## Adding an Author

In the blog folder, there is a file called `authors.yml`. This file contains a list of authors. The authors are listed by their GitHub username. The authors.yml file also contains a list of the authors' names, and their GitHub profile picture.

The authors.yml file is used to create the author section of the blog post. The author section is at the bottom of the blog post. It looks like this:

```
  nbarbarick:
  name: Nathan Barbarick
  title: Documentarian
  url: https://github.com/nbarbarick
  image_url: https://github.com/nbarbarick.png
